# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Purpose

This site is a chat with RAG for MediaWiki. The site user put the question in the prompt window, then the LLM will answer the question with the help of the RAG system.

## Site Specification

### Parts

- **index**: The main page.
  - **Prompt window**: Textbox for user questions.
  - **Send button**: Button to submit the user's question.
  - **Response window**: Displays the response from the RAG system.
  - **RAG window**: Displays the RAG search results.
  - **Data loading button**: Button to start loading the vector store.
  - **data loading meter**: Progress bar showing the status of data loading.
  - **Base URL window**: Textbox for the base URL of the LLM API.
    - Default: ChatGPT default
  - **API Key window**: Textbox for the API key of the LLM service. (hidden characters)
- Backyard:
  - Vector store
  - RAG system
  - LLM interface

### Behavior

  - On clicking the "Data loading" button, the vector store loading process starts.
    - the vector stores on `data/[CURRENT_SITE]/` is loaded on the memory.
    - While the vector store is loading, the data loading meter is displayed.
    - If the vector store is already loaded, the send button is enabled.
  - On clicking the "Send" button, the question in the prompt window is processed:
    - The question is sent to the RAG system.
    - The RAG system searches for relevant documents in the vector store.
    - The LLM generates a response based on the retrieved documents.
    - The response is displayed in the response window.
    - The RAG search results with the link are displayed in the RAG window.

## Inner Specification
  - The JavaScript codes for the site are in the root directory.
  - The HTML and CSS files are in the root directory, index.html and index.css.
  - There is no server-side code. The site made with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
  - The vector store is already created and stored in `data/[CURRENT_SITE]/`.
  - The vector store is loaded as zipped pickle file.
  - tools/rag/xml2vec.py is used to create the vector store zip file.

## Vector Store Generation Steps
1. **Download MediaWiki XML**: Use `tools/fetch/fetch.py` to download the MediaWiki XML dump.
2. **Create Vector Store**: Run `tools/rag/xml2vec.py` to create the vector store from the downloaded XML.
3. **Convert to JSON**: Run `tools/rag/vec2json.py` to convert the vector store to a gzip JSON format.

## implementation notes
- data/[site]/vector_store_\*.json.gz don't include titles and bodies. They include only curids. The titles and bodies are in .xml by curid.
- For body search, the page bodies are converted to vector store.
- For title search, the page titles are converted to vector store.
- The redirecting page behavior:
  - For body search, the redirecting page is not included in the vector store. (because the body is no information)
  - For title search, the redirecting page is included in the vector store and if the vector store is hit, the body of the destination page is shown to the LLM.
